# opm-MultiSMTP (Fork)

This is a fork of the [opm-MultiSMTP](https://github.com/reneeb/opm-MultiSMTP) project originally developed by [Renée Bäcker](https://github.com/reneeb). The purpose of this fork is to provide an essential fix for OAuth2 compatibility until the official Perl Services version is updated.

The original version has an issue where the SMTP configuration for the first email sent is used for subsequent emails, rather than using the configuration associated with the sender's email.

You can download the fixed version for Znuny 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 with the file `MultiSMTP-6.3.3.opm` directly from this repository. To download it correctly:

1. Click on the file link: [MultiSMTP-6.3.3.opm](MultiSMTP-6.3.3.opm).
2. On the file's page, click the "Download" button.
